SCP Threat Map Widget

The SCP Threat Map Widget is a Java Swing application that simulates a live anomaly monitoring system inspired by the SCP Foundation universe. It started as a small personal experiment (I made it because I was bored), but it grew into a fully interactive SCP-style visualization tool.

✨ Features

🌍 Interactive World Map — displays global anomaly events in real-time

📡 Animated Breach Lines — curved arcs between origin and target with pulsing markers

📝 Dynamic Terminal Feed — scrolling logs alternating between [THREAT] and [INVEST] events

🎖 MTF Deployment Simulation — Mobile Task Forces (Epsilon-11, Nu-7, Alpha-1, etc.) are assigned to incidents

🗺 Coordinate Tooltips — hover over the map to see latitude/longitude

⚙️ Automated Simulation — breach events trigger automatically in timed loops

🚀 Usage

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/scp-threat-map-widget.git
cd scp-threat-map-widget


Compile and run:

javac ThreatMapWidget.java
java ThreatMapWidget


Use the "Simulate Attack" button to manually create events or let the auto-simulation run.

📖 Background

This project isn’t a game — it’s more of a visual SCP-style monitoring interface. The design is inspired by tactical command screens you might imagine the SCP Foundation using.

Each event randomly assigns:

A Site (like Site-19 or Site-17)

A Status (Suspected, Confirmed, Containment, etc.)

An MTF Deployment (Nine-Tailed Fox, Hammer Down, Red Right Hand, and others)

I made this project just for fun while bored, but it turned into something SCP fans can enjoy as an immersive “flavor” widget.

📌 Why?

Because I was bored — and sometimes boredom creates the coolest experiments.
